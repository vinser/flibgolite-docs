__Attention users of version 1 !!!__  
The version 2 major update has some improvements to the index structure, configuration and localization. Therefore, to switch to version 2, you should uninstall the version 1 service and install the version 2 service from scratch. Rendexing of the book stock in version 2 is drastically faster than in version 1, especially for FB2 archives, so the transition to version 2 can be completed with acceptable service downtime even for large bookstock.
