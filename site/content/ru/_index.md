On this site I have posted brief information about some software crafts that I developed in my free time.    

They are: __FLibGoLite__, __Pixyne__ and __Burnfix__.  
For your convenience all of them are available on __Windows__, __macOS__ and __Linux__.     

I hope some of them may be useful to you.  
Use them for your pleasure and share with friends.
